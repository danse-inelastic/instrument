"""
renderer of shapes that are typical of neutron components.
This renderer uses vtk.

The convention that is concerned by this module is the simulated data
go through reduction code. The simulated data follows McStas convention,
so the orientations of the banks and tubes are specified by three rotation
angles around x,y,z.

When data goes through reduction package, the coordinate
system changes.

In McStas,

  z -> neutron beam
  y -> inverse gravity

In reduction,

  x -> neutron beam
  z -> inverse gravity

The positions are specified in the reduction coords system. The orientations
are specified in the reduction coords system too, but rotation sequence
is tricky. Please take a look at method _addRotations
